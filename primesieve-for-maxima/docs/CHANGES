New in version 3.4, 05/01/2012
==============================

1. I implemented a new algorithm for medium sieving primes that is up
   to 20 percent faster on todays out-of-order CPUs,
   see src/soe/EratMedium.cpp.
2. I adapted the constants in defs.h due to the new EratMedium
   algorithm, the maximum sieveSize is now 4096 kilobytes (previously
   2048 kilobytes).
3. I revised the Makefiles and INSTALL file.
4. Added docs/LIBPRIMESIEVE and updated README and
   docs/USAGE_EXAMPLES.

New in version 3.3, 19/12/2011
==============================

1. Minor optimizations in src/soe/EratBig.cpp (2% speed up).
2. Improved code readability and documentation of
   src/soe/ParallelPrimeSieve.cpp.
3. The sieveSize must be <= 2048 kilobytes now (previously 8192), this
   makes the WheelFactorization.h & EratBase.h code easier to
   understand.

New in version 3.2, 13/11/2011
==============================

1. Fixed a bug in src/soe/ParallelPrimeSieve.cpp, see ../docs/BUGS.
2. Added 32-bit prime number generation methods to PrimeSieve.
3. Added a PrimeSieve::cancel_sieving exception that allows to cancel
   sieving at run time (see docs/USAGE_EXAMPLES).
4. ParallelPrimeSieve is now able to generate prime numbers using
   multiple threads (previously only multi-threaded counting).
5. The code readability and documentation of WheelFactorization.h/.cpp
   has been improved (e.g. renamed sieveIndex to multipleIndex).
6. PreSieve now initializes its preSieved_ array using a 2nd wheel
   (modulo 6), up to 40 percent faster.
7. I introduced a 'loopLimit' variable in EratSmall that saves some
   calculations and reduces the code size.
8. Added a testFlags(uint32_t) convenience function to PrimeSieve.
9. EratMedium has been simplified, it runs faster than v. 3.1 using
   Intel C++ 12.0 but slightly slower with most other compilers.

New in version 3.1, 24/10/2011
==============================

1. EratBig::sieve(uint8_t*) now processes multiple sieving primes per
   iteration, I measured a speed up of about 6 percent near 1E18.
2. STL containers are now used instead of dynamic memory allocation in
   Erat(Small|Medium) which improves multi-threading performance ~ 3%.
3. The Bucket data structure (WheelFactorization.h) has been modified
   and it performs well now with more compilers.
4. EratMedium has been simplifed, the new code is far easier to
   understand and it is faster with the GNU g++ compiler.
5. Fixed an integer overflow bug in EratMedium.cpp (see BUGS file).
6. The -test option (primesieve console) has been reviewed.
7. I improved the code readability and code documentation, the README
   and INSTALL files have also been revised.

New in version 3.0, 09/07/2011
==============================

1. The source code is now licensed under the New BSD License
   (previously GPL).
2. The source code is now standard C++03 and ISO C99 (stdint.h), i.e.
   I removed all compiler intrinsics and built-in functions:
   80386 BSF, cpuid, SSE4.2 POPCNT.
3. The thread scheduling of ParallelPrimeSieve has been improved,
   10 percent speed up.
4. Prime numbers are now generated using bitScanForward() instead of
   lookup tables, 10 percent speed up.
5. Implemented a fast bit population count function, see
   popcount_lauradoux() in bithacks.h.
6. Revised the option handling in the console version of primesieve,
   added two new options: -o<OFFSET> and -r<PRE-SIEVE>
7. README has been rewritten from scratch.
8. Improved the code readability and revised the comments of the sieve
   of Eratosthenes implementation.
9. ResetSieve has been renamed to PreSieve.

New in version 2.2, 26/05/2011
==============================

1. Added the file docs/USAGE_EXAMPLES which shows how to use
   PrimeSieve and ParallelPrimeSieve objects.
2. Fixed 4 minor bugs (see BUGS).
3. 10% initialization speedup due to enhancement in
   ModuloWheel::setWheelPrime(uint64_t, uint32_t*, uint32_t*, uint32_t*)
4. Added prime number generation functions and a convenience function
   to count prime numbers to PrimeSieve.
5. The thread interface of ParallelPrimeSieve has been simplified.
6. The code now compiles and runs with the sunCC compiler.
7. The code readability has been improved.
8. The documentation has been updated.

New in version 2.1, 11/04/2011
==============================

1. Release of primesieve 2.1 GUI version.
   + fixes start number bug (see BUGS file).
   + supports integer arithmetic expressions as number input.
   + uses threads (OpenMP) instead of processes.
   + added qt-gui/README file.
2. Fixes bug in Makefile when using the LLVM compiler.
3. Updated README file.

New in version 2.0, 15/02/2011
==============================

1. Added soe/ParallelPrimeSieve.cpp which counts primes in parallel
   using OpenMP.
2. Added an arithmetic expression parser (./expr) to ease number input.
3. Added a test suite to the console version of primesieve
   (option: -test) which runs various correctness tests.
4. The console version has been reviewed and is first released.
5. Fixed a minor bug in soe/PrimeNumberFinder.cpp which counts and
   prints the prime preceding the start number (see BUGS file).
6. Improved the memory pool of soe/EratBig.cpp, primesieve 1.0 ran
   into trouble when sieving near 2^64.
7. Makefile modified to better support GCC compatible compilers,
   e.g. make CXX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++
