prime_pi is a maxima function that computes the prime counting function
(or number of prime twins). The function is an interface to
a C++ library written by Kim Walisch and tables compiled
by Tom\'as Oliveira e Silva. At the time this maxima package was written,
it was significantly faster than both Mathematica and sage.

To build and install this package, you must:

1) install the asdf package cl-cffi.
2) install the mext package manager, and packages defmfun1 and maxdoc.
3) build the C++ library. Instructions are in primesieve-for-maxima/README-maxima.lisp
4) start maxima and load ibuild.mac. Eg
 (%i1) load("./ibuild.mac");

Use the package as follows:
(%i1) load(mext);
(%o1)                  /home/username/.maxima/mext.lisp
(%i2) require(prime_pi);
(%o2) /home/username/.maxima/mext/v5.28.0-sbcl-v1.0.57.0.debian/prime_pi.mac
(%i3) prime_pi(10);
(%o3)                                  4
